------------------------------------------
1. Problem Summary

BIG COMPANY is employing a lot of employees. The company would like to analyze its organizational structure and identify potential improvements. The board wants to make sure that
	Salary Compliance:
		1.A managers earns at least 20% more than the average salary of its direct subordinates.
		2.A managers earns no more than 50% more than that average salary of its direct subordinates.
		3.Find the managers who are underpaid or overpaid on average salary of its direct subordinates.
	Reporting Line Compliance:
		1.Company wants no employee should have more than 4 managers between them and the CEO.
		2.Find employees have a reporting line which is too long.

2.Approach
    Salary Compliance
        For each manager,
        1.Compute average salary of direct subordinates.
        2.Calculate minimum required (avg × 1.20) and maximum allowed (avg × 1.50).
        3.Compare manager’s salary:
            - If below minimum → underpaid.
            - If above maximum → overpaid.
        4.Uses OrganizationChart helper class to get subordinates of managers.
        5.Uses SalaryPolicy helper class for thresholds limits of min and maximum salaries.

    Reporting Line Compliance:
        For each employee,
        1.Find the employees whose reporting depth exceeds a threshold.
        2.Compute the depth calculation using iterative loop.
        If depth > 4 → violation.

    EmployeeRepository:
    Load employees from a CSV file to List<Employee>.

3. Design & Architecture
    Classes
        Employee
            Represents an employee record (id, firstName, LastName, salary, managerId).
        EmployeeRepository
            Load employees from a CSV file to List<Employee>.
        SalaryCheckerService
            Holds salary compliance results for a manager (shortfall, excess, thresholds).
        ReportingLineService
            Holds reporting line compliance results (depth, excessDepth).
        SalaryPolicy - It's helper class,
            which contain the salary rules and handle the thresholds limit of min and maximum salaries.We can change rules without modifying other components.
        OrganizationChart - It is help class, which can used for getting subordinates of managers.

- OrganizationalComplianceApp
	- Reads CSV file.
	- Builds employee list.
	- Runs compliance checks.
	- Prints Results.

4. Input
